                <p>The India Gate (formerly known as the All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located near the
                    Kartavya path on the
                    eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi, formerly called duty path. It stands as a
                    memorial to 84,000
                    soldiers of the British Indian Army who died between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in
                    France, Flanders,
                    Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the
                    Third Anglo-Afghan War.
                    13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are
                    inscribed on the gate.
                    Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the architectural style of the memorial arch such as
                    the Arch of
                    Constantine, in Rome, and is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of
                    India in Mumbai.

                    Following the Bangladesh Liberation war in 1972, a structure consisting of a black marble plinth
                    with a reversed rifle,
                    capped by a war helmet and bounded by four eternal flames, was built beneath the archway. This
                    structure, called Amar
                    Jawan Jyoti (Flame of the Immortal Soldier), has since 1971 served as India's tomb of the unknown
                    soldier. India Gate is
                    counted amongst the largest war memorials in India and every Republic Day, the Prime Minister visits
                    the gate to pay
                    their tributes to the Amar Jawan Jyoti, following which the Republic Day parade starts. India Gate
                    is often a location
                    for civil society protests.The India Gate was part of the work of the Imperial War Graves Commission
                    (IWGC), which came into existence in December
                    1918 under the British rule for building war graves and memorials to soldiers who were killed in the
                    First World War.
                    The foundation stone of the gate then called the All India War Memorial, was laid on 10 February
                    1921, at 16:30, by the
                    visiting Duke of Connaught in a ceremony attended by officers and men of the British Indian Army,
                    Imperial Service
                    Troops, the commander in chief, and Chelmsford, the viceroy.On the occasion, the viceroy is
                    reported to have said,
                    "The stirring tales of individual heroism, will live forever in the annals of this country", and
                    that the memorial which
                    was a tribute to the memory of heroes, "known and unknown", would inspire future generations to
                    endure hardships with
                    similar fortitude and "no less valor". The Duke also read out a message by the King, which said,
                    "On this spot, in
                    the central vista of the Capital of India, there will stand a Memorial Archway, designed to keep",
                    in the thoughts of
                    future generations, "the glorious sacrifice of the officers and men of the British Indian Army who
                    fought and fell".
                    During the ceremony, the Deccan Horse, 3rd Sappers and Miners, 6th Jat Light Infantry, 34th Sikh
                    Pioneers, 39th Garhwal
                    Rifles, 59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force), 117th Mahrattas, and 5th Gurkha Rifles

                <h3>Architecture and design
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The memorial gate was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who was not only the main architect of New
                    Delhi but also a member
                    of the Imperial War Graves Commission and one of Europe's foremost designers of war graves and
                    memorials. He designed
                    sixty-six war memorials in Europe, including the highly regarded Cenotaph in London in 1919, the
                    first national war
                    memorial erected after World War I, for which he was commissioned by David Lloyd George, the British
                    prime minister.
                    The memorial in New Delhi, like the Cenotaph in London, is a secular memorial, free of religious and
                    "culturally-specific iconography such as crosses". Lutyens according to his biographer, Christopher
                    Hussey, relied on
                    the "elemental mode", a style of commemoration based on a "universal architectural style free of
                    religious
                    ornamentation".

                    The India Gate, which has been called a "creative reworking of the Arc de Triomphe" has a span of 30
                    feet (9.1 m) and
                    lies on the eastern axial end of Kingsway, present-day Kartavya Path, the central vista and main
                    ceremonial procession
                    route in New Delhi. The 42-metre-tall (138 ft) India Gate stands on a low base of red Bharatpur
                    stone and rises in
                    stages to a huge moulding. The shallow domed bowl at the top was intended to be filled with burning
                    oil on
                    anniversaries, but this is rarely done.[citation needed] The memorial-gate hexagon complex, with a
                    diameter of about 625
                    metres (2,051 ft), covers approximately 306,000 m2 (3,290,000 sq ft) in area.
