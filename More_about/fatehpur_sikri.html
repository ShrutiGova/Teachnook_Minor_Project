                <p>Fatehpur Sikri (Hindi: [ˈfətɛɦpʊɾ ˈsiːkɾiː]) is a town in the Agra District of Uttar Pradesh, India.
                    Situated 35.7
                    kilometres from the district headquarters of Agra, Fatehpur Sikri itself was founded as the
                    capital of Mughal Empire
                    in 1571 by Emperor Akbar, serving this role from 1571 to 1585, when Akbar abandoned it due to a
                    campaign in Punjab and
                    was later completely abandoned in 1610.

                    The name of the city is derived from the village called Sikri which occupied the spot before. An
                    Archaeological Survey
                    of India (ASI) excavation from 1999 to 2000 indicated that there was a habitation, temples and
                    commercial centres here
                    before Akbar built his capital. The region was settled by Sungas following their expansion. It was
                    controlled by
                    Sikarwar Rajputs from the 7th to 16th century CE until the Battle of Khanwa (1527).

                    The khanqah of Sheikh Salim Chishti existed earlier at this place. Akbar's son Jahangir was born in
                    the village of Sikri
                    to his favourite wife Mariam-uz-Zamani in 1569 and in that year Akbar began construction of a
                    religious compound to
                    commemorate the Sheikh who had predicted the birth. After Jahangir's second birthday, he began the
                    construction of a
                    walled city and imperial palace here. The city came to be known as Fatehpur Sikri, the "City of
                    Victory", after Akbar's
                    victorious Gujarat campaign in 1573.
                </p>
                <p>After occupying Agra in 1803, the East India Company established an administrative centre here and it
                    remained so until
                    1850. In 1815, the Marquess of Hastings ordered the repair of monuments at Sikri.

                    Fatehpur Sikri was awarded the status of UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986.

                    Archaeological evidence points to settlement of the region since the Painted Grey Ware period.
                    According to historian
                    Syed Ali Nadeem Rezavi, the region flourished under Sunga rule and then under Sikarwar Rajputs, who
                    built a fortress
                    when they controlled the area from 7th to 16th century, until the Battle of Khanwa (1527). The area
                    later came under the
                    rule of the Delhi Sultanate and many mosques were built at the place which grew in size during the
                    period of the Khalji
                    dynasty.

                    Basing his arguments on the excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in 1999–2000 at
                    the Chabeli Tila,
                    senior Agra journalist Bhanu Pratap Singh said the antique pieces, statues, and structures all point
                    to a lost "culture
                    and religious site," more than 1,000 years ago. "The excavations yielded a rich crop of Jain
                    statues, hundreds of them,
                    including the foundation stone of a temple with the date. The statues were a thousand years old of
                    Bhagwan Adi Nath,
                    Bhagwan Rishabh Nath, Bhagwan Mahavir and Jain Yakshinis," said Swarup Chandra Jain, senior leader
                    of the Jain
                    community. Historian Sugam Anand states that there is proof of habitation, temples and commercial
                    centres even before
                    Akbar established it as his capital. He states that the open space on a ridge was used by Akbar to
                    build his capital.

                <h3>Architecture and design
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Fatehpur Sikri sits on rocky ridge, 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) in length and 1 km (0.62 mi) wide and
                    palace city is
                    surrounded by a 6 km (3.7 mi) wall on three sides with the fourth bordered by a lake. The city is
                    generally organised
                    around this 40 m high ridge, and falls roughly into the shape of a rhombus. The general layout of
                    the ground structures,
                    especially the "continuous and compact pattern of gardens and services and facilities" that
                    characterised the city leads
                    urban archaeologists to conclude that Fatehpur Sikri was built primarily to afford leisure and
                    luxury to its famous
                    residents.

                    The dynastic architecture of Fatehpur Sikri was modelled on Timurid forms and styles.The city was
                    built massively
                    and preferably with red sandstone. Gujarati influences are also seen in its architectural vocabulary
                    and decor of
                    the palaces of Fatehpur Sikri.[28] The city's architecture reflects both the Hindu and Muslim form
                    of domestic
                    architecture popular in India at the time. The remarkable preservation of these original spaces
                    allows modern
                    archaeologists to reconstruct scenes of Mughal court life, and to better understand the hierarchy of
                    the city's royal
                    and noble residents.

                    It is accessed through gates along the 5 miles (8.0 km) long fort wall, namely, Delhi Gate, the Lal
                    Gate, the Agra Gate
                    and Birbal's Gate, Chandanpal Gate, The Gwalior Gate, the Tehra Gate, the Chor Gate, and the Ajmeri
                    Gate. The palace
                    contains summer palace and winter palace for Queen Mariam-uz-Zamani commonly known as Jodha Bai.
