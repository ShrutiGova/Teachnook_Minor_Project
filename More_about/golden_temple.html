                <p>The Golden Temple (also known as the Harmandir Sahib, lit. 'abode of God', Punjabi pronunciation:
                    or the Darbār Sahib, 'exalted court', [is a gurdwara located in the city of
                    Amritsar, Punjab, India. It is the preeminent spiritual site of Sikhism. It is one of the
                    holiest sites in
                    Sikhism, alongside the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Kartarpur, and Gurdwara Janam Asthan in
                    Nankana Sahib.

                    The man-made pool on the site of the temple was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in
                    1577. In 1604,
                    Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru, placed a copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib and is the
                    prominent figure in
                    development of gurudwara who built it in the 16th Century. The Gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by
                    the Sikhs after
                    it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Mughal and invading Afghan
                    armies.
                    Maharaja Ranjit Singh, after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, and
                    overlaid the sanctum
                    with gold leaf in 1830. This has led to the name the Golden Temple.

                    The Golden Temple is spiritually the most significant shrine in Sikhism. It became a centre of the
                    Singh Sabha Movement
                    between 1883 and 1920s, and the Punjabi Suba movement between 1947 and 1966. In the early 1980s, the
                    Gurdwara became a
                    centre of conflict between the Indian government and a movement led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.
                    In 1984, Prime
                    Minister Indira Gandhi sent in the Indian Army as part of Operation Blue Star, leading to deaths of
                    over 1,000 soldiers
                    and civilians, as well as causing much damage to the Gurdwara and the destruction of Akal Takht. The
                    Gurdwara complex
                    was rebuilt again after the 1984 damage.

                    The Golden Temple is an open house of worship for all people, from all walks of life and faiths. It
                    has a square plan
                    with four entrances, and a circumambulation path around the pool. The four entrances to the
                    gurudwara symbolises the
                    Sikh belief in equality and the Sikh view that all people are welcome into their holy place. The
                    complex is a
                    collection of buildings around the sanctum and the pool.One of these is Akal Takht, the chief centre
                    of religious
                    authority of Sikhism. Additional buildings include a clock tower, the offices of the Gurdwara
                    Committee, a Museum and
                    a langar – a free Sikh community-run kitchen that offers a vegetarian meal to all visitors without
                    discrimination.
                    Over 150,000 people visit the holy shrine everyday for worship. The Gurdwara complex has been
                    nominated as a UNESCO
                    World Heritage Site, and its application is pending on the tentative list of UNESCO.

                <h3>Architecture and design
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Golden Temple's architecture reflects different architectural practices prevalent in the Indian
                    subcontinent, as
                    various iterations of temple were rebuilt and restored. The Temple is described by Ian Kerr, and
                    other scholars, as a
                    mixture of the Indo-Islamic Mughal and the Hindu Rajput architecture.

                    The sanctum is a 12.25 x 12.25 metre square with two storeys and a gold leaf dome. This sanctum has
                    a marble platform
                    that is a 19.7 x 19.7 metre square. It sits inside an almost square (154.5 x 148.5 m2) pool called
                    amritsar or
                    amritsarovar (amrit means nectar, sar is short form of sarovar and means pool). The pool is 5.1
                    metre deep and is
                    surrounded by a 3.7 metre wide circumambulatory marble passage that is circled clockwise. The
                    sanctum is connected to
                    the platform by a causeway and the gateway into the causeway is called the Darshani Ḍeorhi (from
                    Darshana Dvara). For
                    those who wish to take a dip in the pool, the Temple provides a half hexagonal shelter and holy
                    steps to Har ki
                    Pauri.Bathing in the pool is believed by many Sikhs to have restorative powers, purifying one's
                    karma. Some
                    carry bottles of the pool water home particularly for sick friends and relatives. The pool is
                    maintained by
                    volunteers who perform kar seva (community service) by draining and desilting it periodically.
                    <br><br>

                    The sanctum has two floors. The Sikh Scripture Guru Granth Sahib is seated on the lower square floor
                    for about 20 hours
                    every day, and for 4 hours it is taken to its bedroom inside Akal Takht with elaborate ceremonies in
                    a palki, for
                    sukhasana and Prakash. The floor with the seated scripture is raised a few steps above the entrance
                    causeway level.
                    The upper floor in the sanctum is a gallery and connected by stairs. The ground floor is lined with
                    white marble, as is
                    the path surrounding the sanctum. The sanctum's exterior has gilded copper plates. The doors are
                    gold leaf-covered
                    copper sheets with nature motifs such as birds and flowers. The ceiling of the upper floor is
                    gilded, embossed and
                    decorated with jewels. The sanctum dome is semi-spherical with a pinnacle ornament. The sides are
                    embellished with
                    arched copings and small solid domes, the corners adorning cupolas, all of which are covered with
                    gold leaf-covered
                    gilded copper.

                    The floral designs on the marble panels of the walls around the sanctum are Arabesque. The arches
                    include verses from
                    the Sikh scripture in gold letters. The frescoes follow the Indian tradition and include animal,
                    bird and nature motifs
                    rather than being purely geometrical. The stair walls have murals of Sikh Gurus such as the falcon
                    carrying Guru Gobind
                    Singh riding a horse.

                    The Darshani Deorhi is a two-storey structure that houses the temple management offices and
                    treasury. At the exit of the
                    path leading away from the sanctum is the Prasada facility, where volunteers serve a flour-based
                    sweet offering called
                    Karah prasad. Typically, the pilgrims to the Golden Temple enter and make a clockwise
                    circumambulation around the pool
                    before entering the sanctum. There are four entrances to the gurdwara complex signifying the
                    openness to all sides, but
                    a single entrance to the sanctum of the temple through a causeway.

                    They also have free service of wheelchair. Anyone can take wheelchair and roam around the temple.
                    Worshipper can take
                    wheelchair from starting entrance and they have a special lift to physically challenged people.
