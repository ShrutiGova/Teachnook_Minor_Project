                <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːlqiːlaː]) is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood
                    of Delhi, India,
                    that historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan
                    commissioned construction of
                    the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red
                    and white, its
                    design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort
                    represents the peak in
                    Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian
                    traditions.

                    The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire
                    in 1739. Most of the
                    fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished by the British following the Indian Rebellion
                    of 1857. The fort's
                    defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress was subsequently used as a garrison.

                    On 15 August 1947, the first prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian flag above
                    the Lahori Gate.
                    Every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the prime minister hoists the Indian tricolour
                    flag at the fort's
                    main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts.

                    The Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort Complex.

                    Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to
                    shift his capital from
                    Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, Shah Jahan's favourite colours,its design is credited to
                    architect Ustad
                    Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal.The fort lies along the Yamuna River, which fed the
                    moats
                    surrounding most of the walls.Construction began in the sacred Islamic month of Muharram, on 13 May
                    1638.: 01 
                    Supervised by Shah Jahan, it was completed on 6 April 1648. Unlike other Mughal forts, the Red
                    Fort's
                    boundary walls are asymmetrical to contain the older Salimgarh Fort.: 04  The fortress-palace was a
                    focal point of
                    the city of Shahjahanabad, which is present-day Old Delhi. Shah Jahan's successor, Aurangzeb, added
                    the Moti Masjid
                    (Pearl Mosque) to the emperor's private quarters, constructing barbicans in front of the two main
                    gates to make the
                    entrance to the palace more circuitous.

                    The World Heritage Convention characterises the Red Fort as representing "the zenith of Mughal
                    creativity". The fort
                    synthesises Islamic palace structure with local traditions, resulting in a confluence of "Persian,
                    Timurid, and Hindu
                    architecture". The fort served as an inspiration for later buildings and gardens across the Indian
                    subcontinent.

                    The Red Fort has an area of 254.67 acres (103.06 ha) enclosed by 2.41 kilometres (1.50 mi) of
                    defensive walls,
                    punctuated by turrets and bastions that vary in height from 18 metres (59 ft) on the river side to
                    33 metres (108 ft) on
                    the city side. The fort is octagonal, with the north–south axis longer than the east–west axis. The
                    marble, floral
                    decorations and the fort's double domes exemplify later Mughal architecture. <br><br>

                    It showcases a high level of ornamentation, and the Kohinoor diamond was reportedly part of the
                    furnishings. The fort's
                    artwork synthesises Persian, European and Indian art, resulting in a unique Shahjahani style rich in
                    form, expression
                    and colour. Red Fort is one of the building complexes of India encapsulating a long period of
                    history and its arts. Even
                    before its 1913 commemoration as a monument of national importance, efforts were made to preserve it
                    for posterity.

                    The Lahori and Delhi Gates were used by the public, and the Khizrabad Gate was for the
                    emperor.[11]: 04  The Lahori Gate
                    is the main entrance, leading to a domed shopping area known as the Chatta Chowk (covered bazaar).
