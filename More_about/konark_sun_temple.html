                <p>Konark Sun Temple is a 13th-century CE (year 1250) Sun temple at Konark about 35 kilometres (22 mi)
                    northeast from Puri
                    city on the coastline in Puri district, Odisha, India.The temple is attributed to king Narasimhadeva
                    I of the
                    Eastern Ganga dynasty about 1250 CE.

                    Dedicated to the Hindu Sun God Surya, what remains of the temple complex has the appearance of a
                    100-foot (30 m) high
                    chariot with immense wheels and horses, all carved from stone. Once over 200 feet (61 m) high, much
                    of the temple
                    is now in ruins, in particular the large shikara tower over the sanctuary; at one time this rose
                    much higher than the
                    mandapa that remains. The structures and elements that have survived are famed for their intricate
                    artwork, iconography,
                    and themes, including erotic kama and mithuna scenes. Also called the Surya Devalaya, it is a
                    classic illustration of
                    the Odisha style of Architecture or Kalinga architecture.
                    The cause of the destruction of the Konark temple is unclear and still remains a source of
                    controversy. Theories
                    range from natural damage to deliberate destruction of the temple in the course of being sacked
                    several times by Muslim
                    armies between the 15th and 17th centuries.This temple was called the "Black Pagoda" in European
                    sailor accounts
                    as early as 1676 because it looked like a great tiered tower which appeared black.Similarly, the
                    Jagannath Temple
                    in Puri was called the "White Pagoda". Both temples served as important landmarks for sailors in the
                    Bay of
                    Bengal. The temple that exists today was partially restored by the conservation efforts of British
                    India-era
                    archaeological teams. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984,it remains a major pilgrimage
                    site for
                    Hindus, who gather here every year for the Chandrabhaga Mela around the month of February.

                    Konark Sun Temple is depicted on the reverse side of the Indian currency note of 10 rupees to
                    signify its importance to
                    Indian cultural heritage.

                <h3>Architecture and design
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The walls of the temple from the temple's base through the crowning elements are ornamented with
                    reliefs, many finished
                    to jewelry-quality miniature details. The terraces contain stone statues of male and female
                    musicians holding various
                    musical instruments including the vina, mardala, gini,[24] Other major works of art include
                    sculptures of Hindu deities,
                    apsaras and images from the daily life and culture of the people (artha and dharma scenes), various
                    animals, aquatic
                    creatures, birds, legendary creatures, and friezes narrating the Hindu texts. The carvings include
                    purely decorative
                    geometric patterns and plant motifs.[24] Some panels show images from the life of the king such as
                    one showing him
                    receiving counsel from a guru, where the artists symbolically portrayed the king as much smaller
                    than the guru, with the
                    king's sword resting on the ground next to him.

                    The upana (moulding) layer at the bottom of the platform contains friezes of elephants, marching
                    soldiers, musicians,
                    and images depicting the secular life of the people, including hunting scenes, a caravan of
                    domesticated animals, people
                    carrying supplies on their head or with the help of a bullock cart, travelers preparing a meal along
                    the roadside, and
                    festive processions. On other walls are found images depicting the daily life of the elite as well
                    as the common
                    people. For example, girls are shown wringing their wet hair, standing by a tree, looking from a
                    window, playing with
                    pets, putting on makeup while looking into a mirror, playing musical instruments such as the vina,
                    chasing away a monkey
                    who is trying to snatch items, a family taking leave of their elderly grandmother who seems dressed
                    for a pilgrimage, a
                    mother blessing her son, a teacher with students, a yogi during a standing asana, a warrior being
                    greeted with a
                    namaste, a mother with her child, an old woman with a walking stick and a bowl in her hands, comical
                    characters, among
                    others. <br><br>

                    The Konark temple is also known for its erotic sculptures of maithunas.These show couples in various
                    stages of
                    courtship and intimacy, and in some cases coital themes. Notorious in the colonial era for their
                    uninhibited celebration
                    of sexuality, these images are included with other aspects of human life as well as deities that are
                    typically
                    associated with tantra. This led some to propose that the erotic sculptures are linked to the vama
                    marga (left hand
                    tantra) tradition. However, this is not supported by local literary sources, and these images may be
                    the same kama
                    and mithuna scenes found integrated into the art of many Hindu temples. The erotic sculptures are
                    found on the
                    temple's Shikhara, and these illustrate all the bandhas (mudra forms) described in the Kamasutra.

                    Other large sculptures were a part of the gateways of the temple complex. These include life-size
                    lions subduing
                    elephants, elephants subduing demons, and horses. A major pillar dedicated to Aruna, called the
                    Aruna Stambha, used to
                    stand in front of the eastern stairs of the porch. This, too, was intricately carved with horizontal
                    friezes and motifs.
                    It now stands in front of the Jagannatha temple at Puri.
