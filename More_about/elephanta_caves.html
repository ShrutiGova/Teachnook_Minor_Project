                <p>The Elephanta Caves are a collection of cave temples predominantly dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva.
                    They are
                    on Elephanta Island, or Gharapuri (literally "the city of caves"),[4] in Mumbai Harbour, 10
                    kilometres (6.2 mi) east of
                    Mumbai in the Indian state of Mahārāshtra. The island, about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) west of the
                    Jawaharlal Nehru Port,
                    consists of five Hindu caves, a few Buddhist stupa mounds that date back to the 2nd century BCE,and
                    two
                    Buddhist caves with water tanks.

                    The Elephanta Caves contain rock cut stone sculptures, mostly in high relief, that show syncretism
                    of Hindu and Buddhist
                    ideas and iconography.[6][9][10] The caves are hewn from solid basalt rock. Except for a few
                    exceptions, much of the
                    artwork is defaced and damaged. The main temple's orientation as well as the relative location of
                    other temples are
                    placed in a mandala pattern.[2] The carvings narrate Hindu mythologies, with the large monolithic
                    5.45 metres (17.9 ft)
                    Trimurti Sadashiva (three-faced Shiva), Nataraja (Lord of dance) and Yogishvara (Lord of Yoga) being
                    the most
                    celebrated.
                    <br>
                    These date to between the 5th and 9th centuries, and scholars attribute them to various Hindu
                    dynasties.They are
                    most commonly placed between the 5th and 7th centuries. Many scholars consider them to have been
                    completed by about 550
                    CE.
                    They were named Elefante – which morphed to Elephanta – by the colonial Portuguese who found
                    elephant statues on the
                    caves. They established a base on the island. The main cave (Cave 1, or the Great Cave) was a Hindu
                    place of worship
                    until the Portuguese arrived, whereupon the island ceased to be an active place of worship. The
                    earliest attempts to
                    prevent further damage to the caves were started by British India officials in 1909. The
                    monuments were restored in
                    the 1970s. In 1987, the restored Elephanta Caves were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is
                    currently
                    maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

                <h3>Geography
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Elephanta Island, or Gharapuri, is about 11 km (6.8 mi) east of the Gateway of India in the Mumbai
                    Harbour and less than
                    2 km (1.2 mi) west of Jawaharlal Nehru Port. The island covers about 10 km2 (3.9 sq mi) at high tide
                    and about 16 km2
                    (6.2 sq mi) at low tide. Gharapuri is a small village on the south side of the island. The Elephanta
                    Caves is
                    connected by ferry services from the Gateway of India, Mumbai between 9AM and 2PM daily, except
                    Monday when the Caves
                    are closed. Mumbai has a major domestic and international airport, as well as is connected to the
                    Indian Railways.

                    The island is 2.4 km (1.5 mi) in length with two hills that rise to a height of about 150 m (490
                    ft). A narrow, deep
                    ravine separates the two hills and runs from north to south. On the west, the hill rises gently from
                    the sea and
                    stretches east across the ravine and rises gradually to the extreme east to a height of 173 m (568
                    ft). Forest growth
                    with clusters of mango, tamarind, and karanj trees cover the hills with scattered palm trees. The
                    foreshore is made up
                    of sand and mud with mangrove bushes on the fringe. Landing quays sit near three small hamlets known
                    as Set Bunder in
                    the north-west, Mora Bunder in the northeast, and Gharapuri or Raj Bunder in the south.

                    There are five rock-cut caves in the western hill and a brick stupa on the eastern hill. The eastern
                    hill has two
                    Buddhist mounds and is called the Stupa hill. Close to the five western hill caves, are Cave 6 and 7
                    on the eastern
                    hill. The most visited and significant cave is on the western hill and is called Cave 1 or the Great
                    Cave, located about
                    a kilometer walk up a steep graded uphill. The Elephanta island is a protected monument area as per
                    the
                    requirements of UNESCO. A notification was issued by the Government of India in 1985 declaring a
                    buffer zone that
                    outlines "a prohibited area" that stretches 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) from the shoreline.<br><br>



                    <b>Description
                    </b> <br>
                    The island has two groups of rock-cut caves, hewn from solid basalt rock. The larger group of caves,
                    which consists of
                    five caves on the western hill of the island, is well known for its Hindu sculptures. The primary
                    cave, numbered as Cave
                    1, is about 1.0 km (0.62 mi) up a hillside, facing the Mumbai harbour. Caves 2 through 5 are next to
                    Cave 1 further
                    southeast, arranged in a row. Cave 6 and 7 are about 200 m (660 ft) northeast of Cave 1 and 2, but
                    geologically on the
                    edge of the eastern hill.[9]

                    The two hills are connected by a walkway. The eastern hill is also called the Stupa hill, while the
                    western hill is
                    called the Canon hill, reflecting their historic colonial-era names, the ancient Stupa and the
                    Portuguese era firing
                    Canons they host respectively.[1]

                    All the caves are rock-cut temples that together have an area of 5,600 m2 (60,000 sq ft). At their
                    most elaborate, they
                    have a main chamber, two lateral chambers, courtyards, and subsidiary shrines, but not all are so
                    fully developed. Cave
                    1 is the largest and is 39 metres (128 ft) deep from the front entrance to the back. The temple
                    complex is primarily the
                    abode of Shiva, depicted in widely celebrated carvings which narrate legends and theologies of
                    Shaivism.[9][19] However,
                    the artwork reverentially displays themes from Shaktism and Vaishnavism traditions of Hinduism as
                    well.
