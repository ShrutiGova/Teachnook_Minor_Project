                <p>The Taj Mahal (Crown of the Palace')[4][5][6] is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum
                    on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by
                    the
                    fifth Mughal
                    emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also
                    houses
                    the tomb of
                    Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a
                    mosque and a guest
                    house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

                    Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases
                    of
                    the project for
                    another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653
                    at a
                    cost estimated
                    at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1
                    billion). The
                    construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led
                    by
                    Ustad Ahmad
                    Lahauri, the emperor’s court architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to
                    reflect natural
                    beauty and divinity.
                    The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim
                    art
                    in India and one
                    of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best
                    example of Mughal
                    architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts more than 6 million
                    visitors a
                    year and in
                    2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.

                <h3>Architecture and design
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic and earlier Mughal
                    architecture. Specific
                    inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of
                    Timur, progenitor of
                    the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand),Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and
                    hasht-behesht
                    (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the Baby Taj), and Shah
                    Jahan's own Jama
                    Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah
                    Jahan
                    promoted the use
                    of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels
                    of
                    refinement. <br><br>

                    <b>Tomb</b> <br>
                    The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a large, white marble
                    structure standing on
                    a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan (an arch-shaped doorway) topped
                    by a
                    large dome and
                    finial. Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Indo-Islamic in origin.

                    The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal
                    eight-sided
                    structure that
                    is approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides. Each side of the iwan is framed
                    with
                    a huge pishtaq
                    or vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of
                    stacked pishtaqs is
                    replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of
                    the
                    building. Four
                    minarets frame the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The main
                    chamber
                    houses the
                    false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.<br><br>

                    </b> <br>
                    Exterior decorations
                    The exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. As the
                    surface area changes, the
                    decorations are refined proportionally. The decorative elements were created by applying paint,
                    stucco, stone inlays or
                    carvings. In line with the Islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms, the
                    decorative elements can be
                    grouped into either calligraphy, abstract forms or vegetative motifs. Throughout the complex are
                    passages from the
                    Qur'an that comprise some of the decorative elements. Recent scholarship suggests that Amanat Khan
                    chose the
                    passages.

                    The calligraphy on the Great Gate reads "O Soul, thou art at rest. Return to the Lord at peace with
                    Him, and He at peace
                    with you." The calligraphy was created in 1609 by a calligrapher named Abdul Haq. Shah Jahan
                    conferred the title of
                    "Amanat Khan" upon him as a reward for his "dazzling virtuosity". Near the lines from the Qur'an
                    at the base of the
                    interior dome is the inscription, "Written by the insignificant being, Amanat Khan Shirazi."
                    Much of the calligraphy
                    is composed of florid thuluth script made of jasper or black marble inlaid in white marble
                    panels. Higher panels are
                    written in slightly larger script to reduce the skewing effect when viewed from below. The
                    calligraphy found on the
                    marble cenotaphs in the tomb is particularly detailed and delicate.

                    <b>Interior decoration

                    </b> <br>
                    Interior decoration
                    The interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements. The inlay
                    work is not pietra
                    dura, but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones.[32] The inner chamber is an octagon
                    with the design
                    allowing for entry from each face, although only the door facing the garden to the south is used.
                    The interior walls are
                    about 25 metres (82 ft) high and are topped by a "false" interior dome decorated with a sun motif.
                    Eight pishtaq arches
                    define the space at ground level and, as with the exterior, each lower pishtaq is crowned by a
                    second pishtaq about
                    midway up the wall. The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each
                    balcony's exterior
                    window has an intricate screen or jali cut from marble. In addition to the light from the balcony
                    screens, light enters
                    through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners. The octagonal marble screen or jali
                    bordering the cenotaphs is
                    made from eight marble panels carved through with intricate pierce work. The remaining surfaces are
                    inlaid in delicate
                    detail with semi-precious stones forming twining vines, fruits and flowers. Each chamber wall is
                    highly decorated with
                    dado bas-relief, intricate lapidary inlay and refined calligraphy panels which reflect, in little
                    detail, the design
                    elements seen throughout the exterior of the complex.
