                <p class="c">Konark Sun Temple is a 13th-century CE (year 1250) Sun temple at Konark about 35 kilometres

                    city on the coastline in Puri district, Odisha, India.The temple is attributed to king Narasimhadeva
                    I of the
                    Eastern Ganga dynasty about 1250 CE. Dedicated to the Hindu Sun God Surya, what remains of the
                    temple complex has the appearance of a 100-foot (30 m) high
                    chariot with immense wheels and horses, all carved from stone. Once over 200 feet (61 m) high, much
                    of the temple
                    is now in ruins, in particular the large shikara tower over the sanctuary; at one time this rose
                    much higher than the
                    mandapa that remains.

                <p class="c">The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that served as the
                    main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort
                    on 12 May 1638, when
                    he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited
                    to architect Ustad
                    Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal
                    architecture under Shah Jahan
                    and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.

                <h1 class="b">Fatehpur Sikri</h1>
                <p class="c">Fatehpur Sikri is a town in the Agra District of Uttar Pradesh, India. Situated 35.7
                    kilometres from the district headquarters of Agra,Fatehpur Sikri itself was founded as the
                    capital of Mughal Empire
                    in 1571 by Emperor Akbar, serving this role from 1571 to 1585, when Akbar abandoned it due to a
                    campaign in Punjab and
                    was later completely abandoned in 1610.

                    The name of the city is derived from the village called Sikri which occupied the spot before. An
                    Archaeological Survey
                    of India (ASI) excavation from 1999 to 2000 indicated that there was a habitation, temples and
                    commercial centres here
                    before Akbar built his capital.

                    BCE, and two
                    Buddhist caves with water tanks.
